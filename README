Indent Guides is a plugin for visually displaying indent levels in gvim.

NOTE 1: 
The plugin only works in gvim at the moment. Support for terminal vim is planned for a future release.

NOTE 2: 
The plugin is untested on Windows and I've just been told it doesn't work. Please check back regularly for a fix.

Features:
- Can detect both tab and space indent styles.
- Automatically inspects your colorscheme and picks appropriate colors.
- Will highlight indent levels with alternating colors.

Usage:
The default mapping to toggle the plugin is <Leader>ig
