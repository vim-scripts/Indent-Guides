Indent Guides is a plugin for visually displaying indent levels in Vim.

FEATURES:
- Can detect both tab and space indent styles.
- Automatically inspects your colorscheme and picks appropriate colors (gVim only).
- Will highlight indent levels with alternating colors.
- Full support for gVim and basic support for Terminal Vim.
- Seems to work on Windows gVim 7.3 (haven't done any extensive tests though).
- Customizable size for indent guides, eg. skinny guides (soft-tabs only).
- Customizable start indent level.
- NEW: Highlight support for files with a mixture of tab and space indent styles.

USAGE:
The default mapping to toggle the plugin is `<Leader>ig`

GVIM:
This plugin should work with gVim out of the box, no configuration needed. It will automatically inspect your colorscheme and pick appropriate colors.

SETTING CUSTOM INDENT COLORS:
Here's an example of how to define custom colors instead of using the ones the plugin automatically generates for you. Add this to your `.vimrc` file:
>
  let g:indent_guides_auto_colors = 0
  autocmd VimEnter,Colorscheme * :hi IndentGuidesOdd  guibg=red   ctermbg=3
  autocmd VimEnter,Colorscheme * :hi IndentGuidesEven guibg=green ctermbg=4
<

Alternatively you can add the following lines to your colorscheme file.
>
  hi IndentGuidesOdd  guibg=red   ctermbg=3
  hi IndentGuidesEven guibg=green ctermbg=4
<

TERMINAL VIM:
At the moment Terminal Vim only has basic support. This means is that colors won't be automatically calculated based on your colorscheme. Instead, some preset colors are used depending on whether `background` is set to `dark` or `light`.

When `set background=dark` is used, the following highlight colors will be defined:
>
  hi IndentGuidesEven ctermbg=darkgrey
  hi IndentGuidesOdd  ctermbg=black
<

Alternatively, when `set background=light` is used, the following highlight colors will be defined:
>
  hi IndentGuidesEven ctermbg=lightgrey
  hi IndentGuidesOdd  ctermbg=white
<

If for some reason it's incorrectly defining light highlight colors instead of dark ones or vice versa, the first thing you should check is that the `background` value is being set correctly for your colorscheme. Sometimes it's best to manually set the `background` value in your `.vimrc`, for example:
>
  colorscheme desert256
  set background=dark
<

Alternatively you can manually setup the highlight colors yourself, see `:help indent_guides_auto_colors` for an example.
